    <p>For this recipe, the secret's in the sauce — well, marinade. A combination of Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, spices, and ketchup guarantees outstanding flavor, even if you're not an experienced griller. The chicken comes out juicy and succulent, and the cooking process is simple.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
        <li>4 long metal skewers</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.</li>

        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.</li>

        <li>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

    </ol>
